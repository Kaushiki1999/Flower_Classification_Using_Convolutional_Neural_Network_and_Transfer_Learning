# Flower_Classification_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Network_and_Transfer_Learning
A deep learning network has been constructed that classifies various flowers. Kaggle's Flower
dataset has been used, which contains 4242 labelled photos in 5 categories, with approximately
800 images for each category. For classification, two distinct transfer learning models have been
compared, i.e., ResNet and Xception, with a custom convolutional neural network model. In order
to reduce overfitting, data augmentation and layer freezing techniques have been implemented.
Predicted outputs have also been shown. This approach to flower categorization may be utilised in
real-time apps, which can help botanists in their research.
